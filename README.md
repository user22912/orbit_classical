# orbit_classical  

Simply simulate orbit in classical physics without calculus.  

## algorithm   
It's simple. You can understand it just from the source code.  

## how can improve  
* Research the feasibility of the software.  
* I've never seen this kind of algorithm before. If you know one, point it out.  
* Make the initial data more completed or accurate.   
* Improve the efficiency. Maybe with multi-threading.  
* Test the software with more powerful machines or time.
